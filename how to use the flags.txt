region flag -w world testr allow-block-place [glass] (to allow placement only of a particular block, for example glass)

region flag -w world testr glide force(it will show you all the flags currently set on a region, you can use it for testing, if you have any doubts, thought it will force players to glide & you might wanna change it back or remove it)
